It feels like we’ve been speaking about this day since we first met.
When we were in very young stage with the whole world at our feet, not knowing where it would take us, not knowing where we would end up.
But over the years, despite the miles wedged between us after our 8th standard, we have spoken every single day,
whether through voice notes, WhatsApp messages, social media memes, or phone calls when our hearts felt heavy and the world felt cruel.
We have celebrated our successes and mourned our failures. We have been each other’s support system, and we have never given up believing in each other
and so today, standing here beside YOU, watching you marry the man of your dreams fills me with so much joy.
<br></br>

So today, my beautiful best friend, enjoy every single moment. Forget about the guests, the food, and the flower arrangements and simply be there with him. 
Forget about the world and let your love for each other be the only thing that guides you through this day. You spend so much of your time worrying about 
everyone else in your life, ensuring they’re happy, being there for them, and today, it’s all about you. Everyone in that room is there for you and for him 
to share this once in a lifetime moment with you.
<br></br>

I promise I’ll be by your side throughout it all. I promise to support you both for whatever adventures this new life as a married couple brings you.
<br></br>
I promise you this is just the beginning, and I am so excited to watch you grow into the kickass, wonderful wife I know you’ll be.<b>
